# Smart Electric Car Side Mirror Adjustment System  

### 📌 Overview  
This project automates **side mirror movement** in electric cars. When the driver sits, mirrors adjust to a preset position, and when the vehicle is parked, they fold automatically to prevent damage and reduce drag.  

### ⚡ Features  
- Auto mirror adjustment using IR detection  
- Mirror fold/unfold based on parking status  
- Servo motor control for smooth operation  
- Increases safety, comfort, and efficiency  

### 🛠️ Components Required  
- Arduino UNO  
- Servo Motors (x2)  
- IR Sensor Module  
- Parking Status Switch  
- Power Supply  

### 🚗 Applications  
- Electric car body electronics  
- Autonomous and smart EV systems  
- Safety and aerodynamics enhancement
